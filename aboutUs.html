                <h1>What is Schicksal?</h1>
                <p>Schicksal is an organization founded in the seventh century to research and combat Honkai. 
                    Three main families—Apokalypse, Kaslana, and Schariac—come with the Schicksal organizational 
                    structure in its long-term evolution as the core has progressively developed. Schicksal has built 
                    fortresses all around the planet to watch and battle the Honkai.</p>

                <p>The primary responsibilities of the family that oversees the "Knight" position are 
                    defense of Schicksal and opposition to the Honkai army. Siegfried Kaslana is the Patriarch of the modern day. Because the Kaslana family 
                    is highly adapted to Honkai, it is also used in numerous hazardous combat missions in 
                    the Honkai area. The Kaslana family members are forceful advocates with distinct social 
                    classes, therefore they are strong enough to protect Schicksal.</p>

                <p>The household in charge of the Honkai's sealing, the "Divine Maiden" duty. The Schariac family's female members are revered as saints. The saints may utilize the 
                    energy of the Honkai to bolster themselves since they have the capacity to control it, 
                    but this manipulation power has a cost. The saints' destiny is to deteriorate and 
                    ultimately perish.</p>

                <p>The Apocalypse that govern Schicksal completely lack strength and power to fight 
                    against the Honkai, unlike the Schariac or the Kaslana., and instead only govern the 
                    organization and facilitate its activities with their intelligence. Their role in 
                    Schicksal is the "Overseer".</p>

                    <p>Valkyries are strong female warriors from Schicksal with either 
                        synthetic or natural stigmata and a great resistance to Honkai.
    
                        The Valkyries are organized into ranks: S, A, B, C, and D. The S rank is reserved for 
                        the most powerful Valkyries, while those ranked B and above are deployed to the 
                        frontlines. Valkyries with a D rank remain at headquarters, handling chores, support, 
                        and logistical duties, away from direct combat. There is also a special Paladin rank, 
                        designated for the personal guard of the Schicksal Overseer. 
                        Additionally, Valkyries are assigned to squads for various missions.
